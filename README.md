## Features

SpoonOS is a living, evolving agentic operating system. Its SCDF is purpose-built to meet the growing demands of Web3 developers — offering a complete toolkit for building sentient, composable, and interoperable AI agents.

- **🧠 ReAct Intelligent Agent** - Advanced agent architecture combining reasoning and action
- **🔧 Custom Tool Ecosystem** - Modular tool system for easily extending agent capabilities
- **💬 Multi-Model Support** - Compatible with major large language models including OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and more Web3 fine-tuned LLM
- **🌐 Web3-Native Interoperability** - Enables AI agents to communicate and coordinate across ecosystems via DID and ZKML-powered interoperability protocols.
- **🔌 MCP (Message Connectivity Protocol)** – Dynamic, protocol-driven tool invocation system. Agents can discover and execute tools at runtime over `stdio`, `http`, or `websocket` transports — without hardcoding or restarts.
- **📡 Scalable Data Access** – Combined with MCP, agents gain seamless access to structured/unstructured data, including databases, Web3 RPCs, external APIs, and more.
- **💻 Interactive CLI** - Feature-rich command line interface
- **🔄 State Management** - Comprehensive session history and state persistence
- **🔗Composable Agent Logic** - Create agents that can sense, reason, plan, and execute modularly — enabling use cases across DeFi, creator economy, and more
- **🚀 Easy to Use** - Well-designed API for rapid development and integration

## ⚙️ Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip package manager (or uv as a faster alternative)

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/XSpoonAi/spoon-core.git
$ cd spoon-core

# Create a virtual environment
$ python -m venv spoon-env
$ source spoon-env/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Prefer faster install? See docs/installation.md for uv-based setup.

## 🔐 API Key & Environment Setup

Create a .env file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-your-claude-key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.rpc
CHAIN_ID=12345
```

Then in your Python entry file:

```bash
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(override=True)
```

For advanced config methods (CLI setup, config.json, PowerShell), see docs/configuration.md.

### Configuration Model

SpoonOS uses a hybrid configuration system that combines a `.env` file for initial setup with a dynamic `config.json` for runtime settings. This provides flexibility for both static environment setup and on-the-fly adjustments via the CLI.

#### Loading Priority

The configuration is loaded with the following priority:

1.  **`config.json` (Highest Priority)**: This file is the primary source of configuration at runtime. If it exists, its values are used directly, **overriding** any corresponding environment variables set in `.env`. You can modify this file using the `config` command in the CLI.

2.  **Environment Variables (`.env`) (Lowest Priority)**: This file is used for initial setup. On the first run, if `config.json` is not found, the system will read the variables from your `.env` file to generate a new `config.json`. Any changes to `.env` after `config.json` has been created will **not** be reflected unless you delete `config.json` and restart the application.

This model ensures that sensitive keys and environment-specific settings are kept in `.env` (which should not be committed to version control), while `config.json` handles user-level customizations and runtime state.

#### `config.json` Parameters

The `config.json` file manages agent and API settings. Below are the supported parameters:

| Parameter       | Type     | Description                                                                                               | Default                               |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `api_keys`      | `object` | A dictionary containing API keys for different LLM providers (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`).      | `{}`                                  |
| `base_url`      | `string` | The base URL for the API endpoint, particularly useful for custom or proxy servers like OpenRouter.           | `""`                                  |
| `default_agent` | `string` | The default agent to use for tasks.                                                                       | `"default"`                           |
| `llm_provider`  | `string` | The name of the LLM provider to use (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`). Overrides provider detection from model name. | `"openai"`                            |
| `model_name`    | `string` | The specific model to use for the selected provider (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`).           | `null`                                |

Here is an example `config.json` where a user wants to use OpenAI. You only need to provide the key for the service you intend to use.

```json
{
  "api_keys": {
    "openai": "sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  },
  "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "default_agent": "default",
  "llm_provider": "openai",
  "model_name": "gpt-4"
}
```

## Using OpenRouter (Multi-LLM Gateway)

```python
from spoon_ai.chat import ChatBot
from spoon_ai.agents import SpoonReactAI

# Using OpenAI's GPT-4
openai_agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model_name="gpt-4", llm_provider="openai")
)

# Using Anthropic's Claude
claude_agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model_name="claude-sonnet-4-20250514", llm_provider="anthropic")
)


# Using OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible API)
# Uses OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenRouter API key
openrouter_agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(
        model_name="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",     # Model name from OpenRouter
        llm_provider="openai",                      # MUST be "openai"
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"     # OpenRouter API endpoint
)
)
```

## 🚀 Run the CLI

### Start the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server with all available tools
python -m spoon_ai.tools.mcp_tools_collection

# The server will start and display:
# MCP Server running on stdio transport
# Available tools: [list of tools]
```

### Start the CLI

```bash
python main.py
```

Try chatting with your agent:

```bash
> action chat
> Hello, Spoon!
```

## 🧩 Build Your Own Agent

### 1. Define Your Own Tool

```python
from spoon_ai.tools.base import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "my_tool"
    description: str = "Description of what this tool does"
    parameters: dict = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "param1": {"type": "string", "description": "Parameter description"}
        },
        "required": ["param1"]
    }

    async def execute(self, param1: str) -> str:
        # Tool implementation
        return f"Result: {param1}"

```

### 2. Define Your Own Agent

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import ToolCallAgent
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolManager

class MyAgent(ToolCallAgent):
    name: str = "my_agent"
    description: str = "Agent description"
    system_prompt: str = "You are a helpful assistant..."
    max_steps: int = 5

    available_tools: ToolManager = Field(
        default_factory=lambda: ToolManager([MyCustomTool()])
    )
```

#### 3. Run the Agent and Interact via Prompt

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    agent = MyCustomAgent(llm=ChatBot())
    result = await agent.run("Say hello to Scarlett")
    print("Result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Register your own tools, override run(), or extend with MCP integrations. See docs/agent.md or docs/mcp_mode_usage.md

## 🔌 Advanced: Use Web3 Tools via MCP

SpoonOS supports runtime pluggable agents using the MCP (Message Connectivity Protocol) — allowing your agent to connect to a live tool server (via SSE/WebSocket/HTTP) and call tools like get_contract_events or get_wallet_activity with no extra code.

Two ways to build MCP-powered agents:

Built-in Agent Mode: Build and run your own MCP server (e.g., mcp_thirdweb_collection.py) and connect to it using an MCPClientMixin agent.

Community Agent Mode: Use mcp-proxy to connect to open-source agents hosted on GitHub.
