## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip package manager

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:XSpoonAi/spoon-core.git
cd SpoonAI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode (optional)
pip install -e .
```

### Install via pip (Coming Soon)

```bash
pip install spoon-ai
```

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

SpoonAI supports various API services that require different API keys. Here are the configuration methods for the main API keys:

### Configuration Methods

1. **Via CLI Command**:
```bash
> config <key_name> <key_value>
```

2. **Via Environment Variables**:
Set the corresponding environment variables in your system

3. **Via Configuration File**:
Edit the `~/.config/spoonai/config.json` file

### Common API Keys

| Key Name | Description | How to Obtain |
|------------|------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for GPT models | [OpenAI Website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for Claude models | [Anthropic Website](https://console.anthropic.com/keys) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | DeepSeek API key | [DeepSeek Website](https://platform.deepseek.com/) |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Blockchain wallet private key for cryptocurrency transactions | Export from your wallet |

### Configuration Examples

```bash
# Configure OpenAI API key
> config OPENAI_API_KEY sk-your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY updated

# Configure Anthropic API key
> config ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-ant-your-anthropic-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY updated

# Configure wallet private key
> config PRIVATE_KEY your-private-key-here
PRIVATE_KEY updated
```

### Key Security Considerations

1. API keys are sensitive; never share them with others or expose them in public
2. Wallet private keys are especially important; leakage may result in asset loss
3. It is recommended to store keys using environment variables or configuration files rather than entering them directly in the command line
4. Regularly change API keys to improve security

## 🧩 Agent Framework

SpoonAI provides a powerful Agent framework that supports two ways of use:
1. Using predefined Agents - Simple declaration and execution
2. Custom Agents - Creating your own tools and logic

### ReAct Intelligent Agent

SpoonAI implements an intelligent agent based on the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm, which is an advanced AI agent architecture that combines reasoning and action capabilities. The ReAct agent can think, plan, and execute in complex tasks, solving problems through an iterative reasoning-action loop.

#### ReAct Workflow

The ReAct agent workflow includes the following key steps:

1. **Observation**: Collecting environment and task-related information
2. **Reasoning**: Analyzing information and reasoning
3. **Acting**: Executing specific operations
4. **Feedback**: Obtaining action results and updating cognition

This cycle repeats continuously until the task is completed or the preset goal is achieved.

### Custom Tools

Creating custom tools is one of SpoonAI's most powerful features. Each tool should inherit from the `BaseTool` class:

```python
from spoon_ai.tools.base import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "my_custom_tool"
    description: str = "This is a custom tool for performing specific tasks"
    parameters: dict = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "param1": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Description of the first parameter"
            },
            "param2": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Description of the second parameter"
            }
        },
        "required": ["param1"]
    }

    async def execute(self, param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> str:
        """Implement the tool's specific logic"""
        # Implement your tool logic here
        result = f"Processing parameters: {param1}, {param2}"
        return result
```

### Custom Agents

There are two ways to create custom Agents:

**Method 1: Inheriting from an existing Agent class**

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import ToolCallAgent
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolManager
from pydantic import Field

class MyCustomAgent(ToolCallAgent):
    name: str = "my_custom_agent"
    description: str = "This is my custom Agent"
    
    system_prompt: str = """You are an AI assistant specialized in performing specific tasks.
    You can use the provided tools to complete tasks."""
    
    next_step_prompt: str = "What should be the next step?"
    
    max_steps: int = 8
    
    # Define available tools
    avaliable_tools: ToolManager = Field(default_factory=lambda: ToolManager([
        MyCustomTool(),
        # Add other tools...
    ]))
```

**Method 2: Directly using ToolCallAgent and configuring tools**

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import ToolCallAgent
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolManager
from spoon_ai.chat import ChatBot

# Create a tool manager
tool_manager = ToolManager([
    MyCustomTool(),
    AnotherTool(),
    # Add more tools...
])

# Create an Agent
my_agent = ToolCallAgent(
    name="my_agent",
    description="Custom configured Agent",
    llm=ChatBot(model="gpt-4"),
    avaliable_tools=tool_manager,
    system_prompt="Custom system prompt",
    max_steps=12
)
```

### Tool Combination and Indexing

SpoonAI supports dynamic tool combination and semantic indexing, allowing Agents to more intelligently select appropriate tools:

```python
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolManager

# Create multiple tools
tools = [
    MyCustomTool(),
    AnotherTool(),
    ThirdTool(),
    # More tools...
]

# Create a tool manager
tool_manager = ToolManager(tools)

# Create a semantic index for tools (requires OpenAI API key)
tool_manager.index_tools()

# Find the most relevant tools based on a query
relevant_tools = tool_manager.query_tools(
    query="I need to analyze this data", 
    top_k=3  # Return the top 3 most relevant tools
)
```

## 🔌 API Integration

SpoonAI supports multiple AI service providers, including:

- **OpenAI** - GPT-3.5/GPT-4 series models
- **Anthropic** - Claude series models
- **DeepSeek** - DeepSeek series models
- **More...** - Easily extendable to support other AI providers

### Integration Examples

```python
from spoon_ai.chat import ChatBot
from spoon_ai.agents import SpoonChatAI

# Using OpenAI's GPT-4
openai_agent = SpoonChatAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model="gpt-4", provider="openai")
)

# Using Anthropic's Claude
claude_agent = SpoonChatAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model="claude-3-opus-20240229", provider="anthropic")
)

# Using DeepSeek
deepseek_agent = SpoonChatAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model="deepseek-llm", provider="deepseek")
)
```

## 💼 Enterprise Application Scenarios

SpoonAI can be applied to various enterprise scenarios:

- **Financial Analysis** - Cryptocurrency market analysis, investment advice, risk assessment
- **Customer Service** - Intelligent customer service, problem-solving, ticket processing
- **Document Processing** - Contract analysis, report generation, content summarization
- **Business Automation** - Process automation, task coordination, intelligent decision support
- **Research Assistant** - Information retrieval, data analysis, research report generation

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Tool Chain Orchestration

SpoonAI supports complex tool chain orchestration, allowing the creation of multi-step, multi-tool execution flows:

```python
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolChain
from spoon_ai.tools.crypto import TokenInfoTool, PriceAnalysisTool

# Create a tool chain
tool_chain = ToolChain([
    (TokenInfoTool(), "Get token information"),
    (PriceAnalysisTool(), "Analyze price trends")
])

# Execute the tool chain
result = await tool_chain.execute("ETH")
```

### Event Listening and Callbacks

SpoonAI provides a powerful event system that supports registering callbacks at different stages of agent execution:

```python
from spoon_ai.callbacks import register_callback

# Register before execution callback
@register_callback("before_execution")
async def before_execution_callback(agent, query):
    print(f"Agent {agent.name} is about to execute query: {query}")

# Register after execution callback
@register_callback("after_execution")
async def after_execution_callback(agent, query, result):
    print(f"Agent {agent.name} completed execution with result: {result}")
```
